# Language Translation from Telugu to Kannada

Our project deals with morphological analysis of Telugu language and thus translating it into Kannada. That is, given a Telugu input text, we generate corresponding text in Kannada language and visa-versa.
Realizing that there are very few such software that actually go in depth with the details of the Dravidian syntax, we took that as our project. So, we decided to develop software for the Dravidian languages (like Kannada, Telugu, etc)
This project has a lot of necessity especially for the immigrants who need assistance to learn the language of the land.
